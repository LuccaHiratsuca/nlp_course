    "\n",
    "You might have figured out by now that searching for words in a large collection is very inneficient. To avoid such searches, many databases implement a data structure called an \"inverted index\".\n",

    "\n",
    "means that \"brazil\" appears in documents 0, 1, and 2, while \"argentina\" appears in documents 2 and 3.\n",

    "You might want to stem/lemmatize the words before implementing the inverted index.\n",
