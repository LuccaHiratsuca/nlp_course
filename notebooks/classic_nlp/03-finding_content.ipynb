         "  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the\nreceiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively\nactivates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of\nRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected\nfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed\nentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\nthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\nsystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples\nshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only\nslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched\nfilter can require significantly more feedback.\n",
