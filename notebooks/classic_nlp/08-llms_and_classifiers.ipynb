    "# TEST 1: Leveraging LLMs for Feature Generation and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, if our data has $N$ features, we need around $10N$ data items to reach peak performance with classic classifiers like Logistic Regression. Therefore, if our vocabulary has 10,000 words, we would need around 1 million items in the training set to reach peak performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting idea regarding this was explored in 2024 in [Balek, V., S'ykora, L., Sklen'ak, V., & Kliegr, T. (2024). LLM-based feature generation from text for interpretable machine learning. ArXiv, abs/2409.07132](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07132). The idea is to use an LLM to generate meaningful and interpretable features from text, and then use Logistic Regression for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the movie plots dataset, we could have features like:\n",
    "- \"Is the protagonist an animal?\" (0 or 1)\n",
    "- \"Does the plot indicate psychological suffering?\" (0 or 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "With a reasonable number of these features, our model could make predictions based on meaningful features instead of raw words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "* Perform feature extraction for a particular dataset\n",
    "* Compare performance and explainability of classifiers with different approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "I highlight a few elements of our usual rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are **NOT ALLOWED** to use AI to generate any code you are asked to make yourself. This includes ChatGPT, CoPilot and all similar generators.\n",
    "* You are **NOT ALLOWED** to use Google or any other search engine.\n",
    "* You are **ALLOWED** to use the offical documentations for libraries: \n",
    "    * [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/)\n",
    "    * [numpy](https://numpy.org/)\n",
    "    * [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n",
    "    * [google AI studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)\n",
    "* You are **ALLOWED** to use previous code from this course as basis.\n",
    "* You **MUST** use the university's proctoring software to show you are complying with these rules\n",
    "* This task is **INDIVIDUAL**. DO NOT share your code or results with anyone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks and Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "* At any point, refer to [Balek et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07132). \n",
    "* Make a well-commented code to solve each one of the tasks below.\n",
    "* Each task will be evaluated as:\n",
    "    * Insufficient: task is not done, off-topic, or low-effort\n",
    "    * In process: task is incomplete, done with a clear conceptual error, or comments \n",
    "    * Proficient: everything works and comments are enough to understand what is being done\n",
    "    * Advanced: everything works, comments are enough to understand what is being done, and code is well organized and formated using functions, dataclasses, and other adequate structures.\n",
    "* This task should be finished by the end of the class.\n",
    "* After you are finished, submit the executed notebook in our LMS system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Dataset Preparation:\n",
    "Adapting Balek et al.'s strategy to our movie plot classification case, create a dataset with at least 100 labeled items and at least 5 meaningful features. None of the features can be the class itself (\"is this a drama plot?\"). Use a clear strategy to avoid exceeding free tier quotas. Store data locally in a format of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Classification:\n",
    "Use the generated features to train a Logistic Regression model. Use cross-validation to select the best hyperparameters. Report accuracy and f1-score for your classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Performance Comparison\n",
    "Compare the performance of the following approaches:\n",
    "1. Traditional Bag-of-Words\n",
    "2. LLM-generated features with Logistic Regression\n",
    "3. Direct classification using LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a bar plot to show the performance differences (choose either accuracy or F1-score).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Improvement Strategies\n",
    "Determine whether labeling more items would improve system performance. Use data to justify your answer.\n"

         "In 2003, Grant Taylor (Alex Kendrick) is the head coach at Shiloh Christian Academy, and has yet to post a winning record in his six-year tenure. After his seventh season begins with a three-game losing streak, the players' fathers start making noises about replacing him with defensive coordinator Brady Owens. This is not the only problem Grant is facing; his car is breaking down, and he discovers that he is the reason that his wife Brooke cannot become pregnant.\r\nHe creates a new coaching philosophy and decides to praise God, no matter what the result. At the same time he guides and urges each one of his players to give the maximum effort, and motivates them to believe they can win under God's guidance. This influence spreads to the rest of the school. From that point on, the Eagles win all their remaining regular season games after losing the first three and make the state playoffs. As a result, Grant is given a raise in salary rather than being fired and is also provided with a brand-new truck from grateful boosters. The Eagles lose their playoff opener, but are declared the winner after the opponent used ineligible players. The Eagles then advance all the way to the state championship game against the three-time defending champion Richland Giants. Even though the Eagles have only a third as many players as the Giants, the Eagles hold their own and ultimately win the game on a 51-yard field goal from a backup kicker who had never kicked more than a 35-yarder before. Grant's prayers for children are also answered as he and Brooke have children after two years.",

         "Shane Jacobson plays Boots who takes his father (Paul Hogan) on a trip to fish on the northernmost tip of Australia because of something his father told him when he was a kid. Although he probably wasn't serious and can't remember it Boots decides to carry it out. They travel on a road trip from Victoria to the Cape York Peninsula in a Holden Kingswood, passing through towns like Tamworth. The film starts with the death of Gracie, Boots' mother and Charlie's wife. After Gracie's death, Boots goes to visit Charlie on the family farm, finding him locked away in the house in the dark, curtains drawn. Boots looks at a calendar on the wall with a picture of Cape York and remembers his father promising to take him fishing off the northernmost tip of Australia. As the trip starts out, Boots and Charlie seem tense but as the days pass they begin to rekindle their father-son relationship.\r\nTheir journey involves visiting different towns, hang-outs in different restaurants, and visiting famous attractions. On their way, they start to reconcile and express their emotions about the recent death of Gracie, Charlie's wife and Boots's mother, and the drama unfolding around the death of Ben, Boots' son, by drowning.\r\nThey even help a young 16-year-old girl named Jess by allowing her to escape her boyfriend Tristan and aid her in her dream to go to the famous country city of Tamworth. The trio manage to arrive in the town, and Jess plays one of her songs in the famous large hall, after passing a manager. They push a car owned by a Tristan out of a car park at night and end up damaging it. They fly in a small aircraft with a pilot (Roy Billing). From the craft, they see the Great Barrier Reef. The pilot continuously hits the altitude meter, making Boots feel nervous. They are dropped off by the pilot and they both wave goodbye as it leaves. In the end, Charlie and Boots both make it to their destination, Cape York, the northernmost tip of Australia. They take their fishing rods and quote a few sentences they traveled with on their journey. As the credits roll, we learn that Jess has been discovered by a music industry manager and has made a single about an obnoxious boyfriend. At the end of the credits, we see a brief clip of Charlie and Boots traveling over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. They look up from their car in awe, causing Boots to marvel at how big the bridge is. Charlie quips \"Yeah... imagine having to paint (it)\" - a dig at Hogan's pre-fame occupation as a worker on it.",
